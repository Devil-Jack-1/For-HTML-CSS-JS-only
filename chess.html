                        <br> The game of chess was born in India during the Gupta dynasty in the 6th century.
                        <br>  Today, more than 1500 years later, it is played in 172 countries.
                        <br> Chess is one of India's contribution to world culture, with games played in the court of kings, to those played in villages, and now, is a professional sport.
                        <br> Chess, as we know it today, was born out of the Indian game chaturanga before the 600s AD. 
                        <br> The game spread throughout Asia and Europe over the coming centuries, and eventually evolved into what we know as chess around the 16th century. 
                        <br> One of the first masters of the game was a Spanish priest named Ruy Lopez. 
                        <br> Although he didn't invent the opening named after him, he analyzed it in a book he published in 1561. 
                        <br> Chess theory was so primitive back then that Lopez advocated the strategy of playing with the sun in your opponent's eyes!

                             The game of chess is played between two opponents who move their pieces alternately
                             on a square board called a ‘chessboard’. The player with the white pieces commences the
                             game. 
                             A player is said to ‘have the move’, when his opponent’s move has been ‘made’.
                             The objective of each player is to place the opponent’s king ‘under attack’ in such a way that the opponent has no legal move. The player who achieves this goal is said to have ‘checkmated’ the opponent’s king and to have won the game. Leaving one’s own king under attack, exposing one’s own king to attack and also ’capturing’ the opponent’s king are not allowed. 
                             The opponent whose king has been checkmated has lost the game.
                             If the position is such that neither player can possibly checkmate, the game is drawn.

                             The chessboard is composed of an 8 x 8 grid of 64 equal squares alternately light (the
                             ‘white’ squares) and dark (the ‘black’ squares).
                             The chessboard is placed between the players in such a way that the near corner square
                             to the right of the player is white.
                             At the beginning of the game one player has 16 light-coloured pieces (the ‘white’ pieces);
                             the other has 16 dark-coloured pieces (the ‘black’ pieces).
                                These pieces are as follows:
                                    A white king 
                                    A white queen

                                It is not permitted to move a piece to a square occupied by a piece of the same colour. If
                                a piece moves to a square occupied by an opponent’s piece the latter is captured and
                                removed from the chessboard as part of the same move. A piece is said to attack an
                                opponent’s piece if the piece could make a capture on that square 
                                A piece is considered to attack a square, even if such a piece is constrained from moving
                                to that square because it would then leave or place the king of its own colour under
                                attack.
                                The bishop may move to any square along a diagonal on which it stands.
                                The rook may move to any square along the file or the rank on which it stands.
                                The queen may move to any square along the file, the rank or a diagonal on which it
                                stands.

                                 The knight may move to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but not on

                                    diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, capturing that piece.
                                <br>d.&gt;A pawn attacking a square crossed by an opponent’s pawn which has advanced two
                                    squares in one move from its original square may capture this opponent’s pawn as
                                    though the latter had been moved only one square. This capture is only legal on the
                                    move following this advance and is called an ‘en passant’ capture.
                                <br>e.&gt;When a pawn reaches the rank furthest from its starting position it must be
                                    exchanged as part of the same move on the same square for a new queen, rook,
                                    bishop or knight of the same colour. The player’s choice is not restricted to pieces
                                    that have been captured previously. This exchange of a pawn for another piece is
                                    called ‘promotion’ and the effect of the new piece is immediate.

                                There are two different ways of moving the king:
                                by moving to any adjoining square not attacked by one or more of the opponent’s
                                piecesor by ‘castling’. 
                                This is a move of the king and either rook of the same colour along
                                the player’s first rank, counting as a single move of the king and executed as
                                follows: the king is transferred from its original square two squares towards the
                                rook on its original square, then that rook is transferred to the square the king has
                                just crossed.

                                [b] with a rook that has already moved.
                                <strong>Castling is prevented temporarily:</strong> 
                                [a] if the square on which the king stands, or the square which it must
                                cross, or the square which it is to occupy, is attacked by one or more of
                                the opponent's pieces, or
                                [b] if there is any piece between the king and the rook with which castling is
                                to be effected.
                                The king is said to be 'in check' if it is attacked by one or more of the opponent's pieces,
                                even if such pieces are constrained from moving to that square because they would then
                                leave or place their own king in check. No piece can be moved that will either expose the
                                king of the same colour to check or leave that king in check.

                                <br>1. e4 e5
                                <br>2. Nf3 Nc6

                                <br>This opening is defined by the development of the white bishop to c4 (the so-called "Italian bishop"), where it attacks Black's vulnerable f7-square. It is part of the large family of Open Games or Double King's Pawn Games.
                                <br>The Italian Game is one of the oldest recorded chess openings; it occurs in the Göttingen manuscript and was developed by players such as Damiano and Polerio in the 16th century, and later by Greco in 1620, who gave the game its main line. It has been extensively analyzed for more than 300 years.
                                <br> term Italian Game is sometimes used interchangeably with Giuoco Piano, although the latter also refers particularly to play after 3...Bc5.

                            <em>The Ruy Lopez (/rɔɪ, ˈruːi/; Spanish: [ˈruj ˈlopeθ]),[1] also called the Spanish Opening or Spanish Game, is a chess opening characterised by the moves:
                                <br>1. e4 e5
                                <br>2. Nf3 Nc6
                                <br>3. Bb5
                                <br>The Ruy Lopez is named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura. It is one of the most popular openings, with many variations. In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO), all codes from C60 to C99 are assigned to the Ruy Lopez.
                                <br>History
                                <br>The opening is named after the 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura, who made a systematic study of this and other openings in the 150-page book on chess Libro del Axedrez, written in 1561.
                                <br>[2] Lopez advocated 3.Bb5 as superior to 3.Bc4, and was of the opinion that Black should play 2...d6 (the Philidor Defence) to avoid it. Although it bears his name, this particular opening was included in the Göttingen manuscript, which dates from c. 1490.
                                <br>[3] A popular use of the Ruy Lopez opening did not develop, however, until the mid-19th century, when the Finnish and Russian
                                <br>[4] theoretician Carl Jaenisch "rediscovered" its potential. The opening remains the most commonly used amongst the open games in master play; it has been adopted by almost all players during their careers, many of whom have played it with both colours.
                                <br>[5] Due to the difficulty for Black in achieving equality, a common nickname for the opening is "The Spanish Torture".</em>

                                <br>1. e4 e6
                                <br>This is most commonly followed by 2.d4 d5. 
                                <br>{1}Black usually plays ...c5 soon after, attacking White's pawn centre and gaining space on the queenside.
                                <br>[2] The French has a reputation for solidity and resilience, although some lines such as the Winawer Variation can lead to sharp complications. Black's position is often somewhat cramped in the early game; in particular, the pawn on e6 can impede the development of the bishop on c8.
                                <br>[3]Position after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5
                                <br>[4]Following the opening moves 1.e4 e6, the main line of the French Defence continues 2.d4 d5 (see below for alternatives). White sets up a pawn centre, which Black immediately challenges by attacking the pawn on e4. The same position can be reached by transposition from a Queen's Pawn Game after 1.d4 e6 2.e4 d5 or the declining of a Blackmar–Diemer Gambit after 1.d4 d5 2.e4 e6.
                                <br>White's options include defending the e4-pawn with 3.Nc3 or 3.Nd2, advancing it with 3.e5, or exchanging it with 3.exd5, each of which leads to different types of positions. Defending the pawn with 3.Bd3 allows 3...dxe4 4.Bxe4 Nf6, when Black gains either a tempo or the advantage of the two bishops</em>

                                <br>The Caro–Kann is a common defence against the King's Pawn Opening. 
                                <br>It is classified as a Semi-Open Game, like the Sicilian Defence and French Defence, although it is thought to be more solid and less dynamic than either of those openings. 
                                <br>It often leads to good endgames for Black, who has the better pawn structure. 
                                <br>It allows Black to circumvent enormous bodies of theory in 1.e4 openings such as the Ruy Lopez and the Sicilian Defence.
                                <br>Unlike its sister opening, the French Defence, the Caro–Kann does not hinder the development of Black's light-squared bishop. 
                                <br>However, it comes at the cost of a tempo because Black has to play 1...c6 before pushing the pawn to c5, whereas Black can push c7–c5 in one move in the French Defence. 
                                <br>White can combat the Caro–Kann in several different ways, often gaining a space advantage; additionally, Black has less mobility and can lag in development.</em>

                            <em>The King's Indian Defence (or KID) is a common chess opening. It is defined by the following moves:
                                <br>1. d4 Nf6
                                <br>2. c4 g6
                                <br>Black intends to follow up with 3...Bg7 and 4...d6 (the Grünfeld Defence arises when Black plays 3...d5 instead and is considered a separate opening). 
                                <br>White's major third move options are 3.Nc3, 3.Nf3 or 3.g3, with both the King's Indian and Grünfeld playable against these moves. 
                                <br>The King's Indian is a hypermodern opening, where Black deliberately allows White control of the centre with pawns, with the view to subsequently challenge it. 
                                <br>In the most critical lines of the King's Indian, White erects an imposing pawn centre with Nc3 followed by e4. 
                                <br>Black stakes out their own claim to the centre with the Benoni-style ...c5, or ...e5. 
                                <br>If White resolves the central pawn tension with d5, then Black follows with either ...b5 and queenside play, or ...f5 and an eventual kingside attack. 
                                <br>Meanwhile, White attempts to expand on the opposite wing. The resulting unbalanced positions offer scope for both sides to play for a win.</em>

                                <br>It is one of the oldest chess openings, having been discussed in literature by 1497. 
                                <br>It was advocated by Howard Staunton, generally considered the world's strongest player from 1843 to 1851, in his 1847 book The Chess-Player's Handbook. 
                                <br>For some decades, it was often called "Staunton's Opening" or the "English Knight's Game" as a result. 
                                <br>Today, it is usually known by the name of Domenico Lorenzo Ponziani, whose main contribution to the opening was his introduction, in 1769, of the countergambit 3...f5!?
                                <br>The opening is now considered inferior to 3.Bb5, the Ruy Lopez, and 3.Bc4, the Italian Game, and is accordingly rarely seen today at any level of play. 
                                <br>Magnus Carlsen used it for a victory in 2013.[1] Black's main responses are 3...Nf6, leading to quiet play, and 3...d5, leading to sharp play. <br>Ponziani's countergambit 3...f5!? was successfully played in the grandmaster game Hikaru Nakamura–Julio Becerra Rivero, US Championship 2007.</em>

                                <br>The other bishop is developed to d3 (or occasionally e2) and the knights typically to f3 and d2.

                                <br>Pawn structure and weak squares are closely related. Every "outpost" square, hole, and "weak color complex" was essentially created by a pawn move or capture of some kind (or lack thereof in some cases).

                                <br>The space of a position or "your space" is the number of safe squares available to your pieces at any given time. Essentially, your pieces have more freedom (or more options) when you have more space.
                                <br>Space is dictated by pawn play in many ways, and "your space" is essentially all the squares you control behind your most advanced pawns (or pawns within the enemy's territory).
                                <br>Learning to correctly use space and "build strength" in your position is critical. Most amateur players have little knowledge of how to use a space advantage (or how to play against an opponent's space advantage). For instance, many players trade pieces soon after achieving a space advtange. <br>This is a big mistake, as the player with more space generally wants all possible pieces on the board.
                                <br>There are countless more examples of "misplayed space" and many specific themes within the concept of space. Though you will not master these concepts for some time, now is the time to get started!

                                <br>The power and activity of your pieces, along with the ability to make threats against your opponent, is known as the "initiative" in chess. 
                                <br>Often players are fighting for initiative, while at the same time, always striving for a material or "concrete" advantage.
                                <br>Knowing how to value both the initiative and the more concrete factors (which can be seen as either material or large positional advantages, depending on the position) is a very difficult thing to do in chess: Should I sacrifice my knight here for two pawns and the initiative against my opponent's king or not perhaps ,depends on the position.
                                <br>Often it takes a master-level understanding to correctly weigh the initiative and the concrete features of a position, but it is time for you to take the first steps towards learning to balance these factors in your own games!

                                <br>Despite losing a historic match to the computer engine Deep Blue two years earlier, Garry Kasparov was at the height of his powers in 1999, winning tournaments by big margins and recording the highest Elo rating ever at that time (2851). Kasparov has a long list of brilliancies to his credit, but this game is his virtually undisputed masterpiece.
                                <br>Kasparov vs. Topalov is everything a chess game should be, a ferocious fight with brilliance from both players, numerous tactical themes, and a king hunt that drives the king all the way from one side of the board to the other! It's difficult to imagine any other game atop this list, but we eagerly await new contenders in the coming years.

                                <br>It illustrates the value of development, centralization, and king safety, but most important, it is the perfectly concise game to illustrate the beauty of chess. What chess player can fail to smile at 10.Nxb5!, 13.Rxd7!, and 16.Qb8+!!?
                                <br>Morphy won this game in the midst of his European Tour where he easily defeated the other great players of his day before virtually retiring from chess to pursue law in New Orleans.

                                        <br>José Raúl Capablanca y Graupera (19 November 1888 – 8 March 1942) was a Cuban chess player who was the third world chess champion from 1921 to 1927. A chess prodigy, he is widely renowned for his exceptional endgame skill and speed of play.
                                        <br>Capablanca was born in 1888 in the Castillo del Príncipe, Havana. 
                                        <br>He beat Cuban champion Juan Corzo in a match on 17 November 1901, two days before his 13th birthday.His victory over Frank Marshall in a 1909 match earned him an invitation to the 1911 San Sebastián tournament, which he won ahead of players such as Akiba Rubinstein, Aron Nimzowitsch and Siegbert Tarrasch. Over the next several years, Capablanca had a strong series of tournament results. 
                                        <br>After several unsuccessful attempts to arrange a match with then world champion Emanuel Lasker, Capablanca finally won the world chess champion title from Lasker in 1921. Capablanca was undefeated from 10 February 1916 to 21 March 1924, a period that included the world championship match with Lasker.
                                        <br>His famous quote is "You may learn much more from a game you lose than from a game you win. You will have to lose hundreds of games before becoming a good player"
